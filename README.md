The Enigma machine was a cipher device used primarily by Nazi Germany during World War II to encode military communications. 
It looked like a typewriter, but its genius lay in its internal rotors and electrical pathways. When a key was pressed, the current passed through these rotors, transforming the letter into a different one according to a secret pattern. 
The rotors would shift positions after each keystroke, ensuring the code constantly changed, making the Enigma an incredibly sophisticated tool for its time.

To make the Enigma machine even more complex, I modified it by adding an extra rotor to increase the possible combinations. 
In addition to this, I changed the mechanism so that each rotor rotates two steps per character encoded instead of one. 
These modifications significantly increased the difficulty of breaking the code, as the number of potential cipher states multiplied, making it harder for any cryptanalyst to decode the message.
